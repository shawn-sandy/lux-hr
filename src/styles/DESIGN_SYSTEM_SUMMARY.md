# HR Consulting Design System - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

I have successfully analyzed the HR consulting website design image and created a comprehensive CSS/SCSS design system that captures the visual language and component patterns from the original design.

## Design Analysis

### Color Palette Extracted

From the image analysis, I identified these key colors:

**Primary Color (Brown/Chocolate Brand Color)**

- `#6b4423` - Dark brown used for main navigation, headers, and primary buttons
- Derived from the warm, professional aesthetic of the website layout

**Secondary Color (Orange/Coral Accent)**  

- `#ff6b35` - Orange accent color from the woman's clothing in the hero image
- Creates a warm, energetic contrast to the brown primary color

**Neutral Colors**

- Various shades of gray, white, and off-white for backgrounds and text
- Ensures proper contrast and readability

### Typography Analysis

- **Primary Font**: Inter - Clean, modern sans-serif for body text and UI elements
- **Display Font**: Playfair Display - Elegant serif for large headings and brand elements
- **Hierarchy**: Clear scale from 12px to 48px+ for comprehensive text sizing

### Spacing & Layout Patterns

- **4px Grid System**: Consistent spacing based on multiples of 4px
- **Card-based Design**: Service cards with icons, titles, and descriptions
- **Two-column Layouts**: Hero sections with text + image arrangements
- **Container System**: Centered layouts with responsive padding

## Files Created

- Semantic typography classes (hero-title, section-title, card-title)
- Line height and letter spacing scales

### 3. Spacing System

- Comprehensive margin and padding utilities
- Semantic spacing tokens (section-spacing, card-padding, container-spacing)
- Grid gap utilities for layout systems

### 4. Layout Utilities

- Complete flexbox and CSS Grid utility classes
- Responsive container system

- Semantic component classes for specific use cases
- Balance between utility and component approaches

### 3. Accessibility Features

- WCAG AA compliant color contrast ratios
- Focus states for all interactive elements
- Screen reader friendly markup and utilities
- Semantic HTML structure throughout

### 4. Modern CSS Features

- CSS custom properties for runtime customization
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Modern CSS functions and calculations
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
